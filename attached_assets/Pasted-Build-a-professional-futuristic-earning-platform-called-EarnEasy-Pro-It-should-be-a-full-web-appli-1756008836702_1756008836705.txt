Build a professional, futuristic earning platform called EarnEasy Pro. It should be a full web application with separate files and folders (not a single HTML). The structure must be ready for Vercel hosting using React + Vite or another modern frontend setup. The app should include:

Core Features:

Authentication: Email/password sign-up and login using Firebase Authentication, with email verification and password reset.

Database: Use Firebase Firestore. Each user has a document with UID as the ID. Fields: email, name, balance, adsWatched, withdrawnAmount. Subcollection transactions with fields: type (earn/withdraw), amount, timestamp.

Wallet System: Display balance, watch ads to earn money. Withdrawals allowed only when balance ≥ $10. Show withdrawal options: JazzCash, EasyPaisa, NayaPay, SadaPay, Bank Transfer.

Tabs/Pages:

Home: Ads watching section (simulate with placeholders).

Wallet: Show balance, transactions.

Updates: Show updates or “No updates yet”.

Account: Show user details, logout option.


Dark/Light Mode: Toggle button to switch themes, theme persists.

Design & Animations: Attractive neon cyber theme with smooth animations. Every button click shows a robot loader animation (a cute CSS/JS animated robot sitting on “Loading…” text). Robot animation also appears while fetching wallet data, updates, or transactions.

Floating WhatsApp Button: Always visible at the bottom-right corner.

Stats Section: Show total withdrawals, total accounts registered, total visitors.

Responsiveness: Fully mobile-friendly and accessible.


Technical Requirements:

Project must have clear folder structure:

src/ for React components (Home.jsx, Wallet.jsx, Updates.jsx, Account.jsx, RobotLoader.jsx).

styles/ for CSS or Tailwind configuration.

firebase.js for Firebase initialization.

App.jsx and main.jsx as entry points.


package.json with correct dependencies (React, Firebase, Tailwind, Framer Motion for animations).

Deployment-ready with npm run build for Vercel.

Secure Firestore rules (only user can access their own data).

Show robot loader while switching tabs and performing any action (earn, withdraw, update).


User Flow:

New user signs up → email verification.

Logs in → lands on Home (ads section).

Navigates to Wallet to see balance and transactions.

Withdraw button shows available methods only if balance ≥ $10.

Updates page shows updates or “No updates yet” with animation.

Account page shows user info and logout.


Goal: A futuristic, attractive, international-level website that feels professional, modern, and engaging. The code must be clean, modular, and deployable instantly on Vercel.”
